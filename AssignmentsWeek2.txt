Hello CodeSchool apprentice! Welcome to week 2 where you will play around with some css.

Assignment #1

Oh boy! The website looks too colorfull, no Scandinavian feel at all. The BESTSELLER brand is not represented correctly. Please change the background and title colors.
-Change the background to this color: #f1f1f1
-Change the titles to this color: #867d6b
This should take you about 5-10 minutes


Assignment #2

It is time for some spring cleaning! We have changed our styling standards and want to make things more neat. We want you to move the inline css to the seperate css file called style.css and apply it using the relevant ID's and/or classes.
This should take you about 10-15 minutes

Assignment #3

The website is looking much better already. Let's improve BESTSELLER's brand identity by changing the main font and the font of the titles.
-Change the main font to : "Work Sans", sans-serif;
-Change the font of the titles to : "Adelle", serif;
This should take you about 10-15 minutes

Assignment #4

Now let's take a look at the product pages and take a moment to check out the Men's, Women's and Kid's collection. Do you notice something about the borders? They don't look very nice do they. Please adjust the borders and give it a more minimalist look. 
-We would like the border to be solid, 1px and the color #0088fd

This should take you about 5-10 minutes.

Wow, you did a great job today! Thank you for cleaning up the website. Next week we will introduce you to JavaScript... are you ready to be challenged?!
